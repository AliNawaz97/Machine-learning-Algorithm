# Supervised learning algorithms
## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm for predicting the continuous or quantitative variable 
## Types of linear regression
### 1.  Simple linear regression
It is a very simple method for predicting variable on the basis of a single predictor
Y = β0 + β1X.
### 2. Multiple linear regression
Predict quantitative variable on the basis of multiple variables
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βpXp + ε
# Steps involve in linear regression
Calculate the mean of X values and Y values which may be X^bar and Y^bar
Calculate the slope of line m
Calculate the Y-intercept of the line by using c = Y^bar - mX^bar

# K-means clustering
Clustering means the grouping of similar data.
There are a lot of clustering algorithms but one of the most common is k-means clustering.
# Steps in K-means algorithm 
Assign random centroids(k-centroid)
Calculate distance from every point for every centroid
Assign points to those centroids with minimum distance and make clusters
Calculate mean from each cluster
Repeat step 2-4 till get same clusters

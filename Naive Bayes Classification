# Naive Bayes classification
Naive Bayes classification is a supervised learning algorithm which is used to classify data into predefined classes.
It uses the concept of conditional probability to classify the test data that is based on applying Baye's theorem
## Conditional Probability
It helps us to find the probability that something will happen given that something will happen given that something else has happened
Consider two events A and B, then conditional probability is given as;
### P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)
## Bayes' theorem
Bayesâ€™ theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event
### P(L | features) = P(features | L) P (L) / P(features)

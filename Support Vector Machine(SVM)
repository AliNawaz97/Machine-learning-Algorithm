# Support Vector Machine
Support Vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression problems. The goal of SVM is to find hyperplane which divides the two cllasses of data.
A hyperplane which divide two classes with maximum distances is called as optimal hyperplane.
SVM is mostly used for classification. In classication SVM, hyperplane separate features from each other.
SVM is used in text categorization, image segmentation and Handwriitten recognition.
